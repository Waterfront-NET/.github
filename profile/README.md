# Waterfront

Open Source Docker Registry authorization server

## Warning

Project is in active development and early pre-release stage.
Use packages marked with `alpha` pre-release version with caution, because
APIs are changing rapidly.

## Documentation

Currently there are no docs on the project
and it will probably stay like that until the stable release.

At the time you can use XML docs where present, or just read into the code,
most APIs are self-explanatory.

Also there are many examples in the [Waterfront][waterfront] repository, which itself is an authorization server implementation
compatible with the registry v2
